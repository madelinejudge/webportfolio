    <h3>Lansing Roots Brochure</h3>
  	  <p>As part of an internship with the Greater Lansing Food Bank's Lansing Roots program, I created this brochure explaining the concept and details of their Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program. I chose to create this brochure using Microsoft Word so that my supervisor would be able to edit on her computer as well. Due to budget constraints, the brochure was required to have minimal colors and be able to be printed in the Lansing Roots office. This brochure design met the requirements and I was able to include professional photographs and the organization's logo colors as well, creating a more aesthetically-pleasing design.</p>
    
    <h3>Feeding the Future UURAF Poster</h3>
    <p>As part of a funded grant, I presented my research project, Feeding the Future, at the University Undergraduate Research and Arts Forum. I designed my poster using Microsoft PowerPoint and used photos from Twitter and Facebook. I also wrote all of the content, pulling themes from my research analysis.</p>
